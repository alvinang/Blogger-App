## Information

### Summary

This app uses the "blogger" tutorial from [JumpStartLab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html):. There are a few
slight modifications that I made from this tutorial:

* Used [Twitter Bootstrap Rails](https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails):
* Installed [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise): instead of Sorcery
* Did not install paperclip

This app is created using rails 4.0.0 and ruby 2.0.0p195.

### Creating an Admin Model

If this is your own blog, you want to avoid having others creating articles. To do that, extend devise and add an Admin role.
See the tutorial here [Devise Admin Role](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Add-an-Admin-role):

### Minor Update

* Rails 4 does not built in "attr_accessible". Used "protected_attributes" gem instead, for now.
* To use devise on Rails 4, specify branch. See gemfile for more information.

### Next Steps

* Only allow one user to create articles
* Improve entire website flow
* Clean & Improve UI
* Add static pages
* Use mysql2 gem in production
* Create brief statistics dashboard
* Slim down controllers
* Mess with Draper
* Using digitalocean - need to setup server, install git
* Capistrano to improve workflow

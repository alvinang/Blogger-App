This app uses the "blogger" tutorial from JumpStartLab (http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).
JumpStartLab did great job creating many robust tutorials.

In this app, I used rails 4.0.0 and ruby 2.0.0p195.

Instead of using the nicely done CSS provided by JumpStartLab, I used Twitter Bootstrap instead (https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails).
